# First GAP Days
## August 25-29, 2014, RWTH Aachen

The aim of this meeting is to bring together [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org)
developers and users to exchange ideas and influence the future development of
GAP. The meeting will be used to advertise recent developments in core GAP
(e.g., [HPC-GAP](http://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/hpcgap.php))
and new packages (e.g.
[AutoDoc](https://github.com/homalg-project/AutoDoc),
[libsing](http://gap-system.github.io/libsing/), ...).

Besides talks, there will also be open discussion rounds (about problems,
ideas, and possible solutions regarding GAP’s future) and several coding
sprints (where some people sit together to implement a fix or a new feature,
or write documentation, or…). In addition, as enough GAP experts will be
around for technical support, the meeting also offers a good opportunity for
people to work on their own packages. At the end of the week, we would be
happy to hear about any progress you made.
