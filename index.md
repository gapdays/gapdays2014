# First [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days
## August 25-29, 2014, RWTH Aachen University

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users are invited to influence the future
development of GAP by initiating and contributing to discussions and coding sprints.
As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the meetings also offers
a good opportunity for people to work on their own packages. To streamline each meeting
the organizers will usually suggest few main topics to address during the week.
The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages. At the end of the week, we would be happy to hear about any progress
you made.
