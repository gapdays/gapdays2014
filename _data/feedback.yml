  feedback: As an author of GAP packages, participating in the GAP Days 2014 was for me an exceptional opportunity both to get feedback on my work and to get hints for some future work. Not of less importance was to hear about recent developments mainly in terms of new packages or new features of existing ones, as well as to keep informed of what the future of GAP can be.

  feedback: The meeting GAPDays2014 has been of great interest for me. Apart from the nice talks and discussions after them, the opportunity to meet some of the developers of other packages has been not only a pleasure and honor, but a chance to learn a lot from them. <br/> In particular the development version of  our (M. Delgado and I; see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdelgado/numericalsgps">https://bitbucket.org/mdelgado/numericalsgps</a>) package numericalsgps already contains functions that make use of NormalizInterface (thanks to C. Söger to help me install it on my computer) and libsing (thanks to M. Horn for guiding me through the installation). As an example, discussions with H. Schöneman yield a new implementation of the homogeneous Betti elements of a numerical semigroup (and thus the homogeneous catenary degree). For instance, for <100,123,145,156,167,201,210,221,309> it takes 154 milliseconds with libsing, compared with the 85942 that takes with the gap built in Gröbner basis  computation. <br/> We hope that these improvements will also allow us to extend the scope of some functions that work now only for numerical semigroups (including affine semigroups, and in particular block monoids). <br/> For all this, I would like to thank again the organizers for their great job, and also the rest of participants. I hope that (brainstorm) meetings will take place again in a near future.

  feedback: I learned how to make a package and to use AutoDoc. I (re)learned about the existence and use of ToDo lists in homalg. I decided to work together with Frank Lübeck and Hebert Pérez-Rosés in order to combine our respective code pieces to maybe publish a bunch of packages that will in the end constitute a GAP4 replacement for CHEVIE.

  feedback: During the GAP Days 2014, I had the pleasure to do networking with the participants. Through the talks and workshop I got to learn about different GAP packages and coding with GAP. There were several interesting afternoon talks and morning coding sessions. I benefitted tremendously from this workshop and I hope will be able to participate in the future GAP Days.

  feedback: Most important to me was having the opportunity to test hpcgap with a range of applications and package. Pleasingly it stood up quite well and porting simpler packages to run under it seems be fairly routine. I also had  number of useful discussions about the future direction and governance of GAP.

- name: Hebert Perez
  feedback: My attendance to GAP Days 2014 was very fruitful. Besides making my work known to other GAP users and developers, and learning about the other participants' contributions, I had the opportunity to discuss with them about future GAP contributions, more precisely about potential GAP packages to deal with labeled directed graphs and Coxeter groups, respectively. In our consideration, current GAP functionality for those mathematical objects is limited and outdated. Work on those packages has already started. Moreover, I could profit from the expertise of the other participants to finish the translation of some old GAP 3 code into GAP 4.

  package: NormalizInterface
  feedback: We did further work on the interface to make installation easier and to supply a clearer and more powerful interface. Also a first user started to utilize the package and helped to find bugs. We hope to publish a first version to the public soon.
